# Friday
This is a personal project. It is a gift for my girlfriend (because she was waiting for Friday). :heart:  The source code is released just as a portfolio and maybe for educational purposes.

If you want to make any change or have your own build, the source code is under MIT license for simplicity.

###### How to edit the code and create your own build
You must have NodeJS and NPM installed first. Then clone or download this repository. The source code is located at [`src/index.js`](src/index.js).

After downloading and editing the code, run the npm command `npm run build` and a new build will be available on the `dist` folder. Usually withing the folder `friday-[version].browser` were `[version]` is specified at [`webpack.config.js`](webpack.config.js) at the very top, under the variable `softwareVersion`. Enjoy!
